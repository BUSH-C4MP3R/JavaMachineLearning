# JavaMachineLearning
In progress library for machine learning in Java. Currently has multivariable linear and logistic regression. 

## Sample use: 

```
public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
        //reading data 
        Matrix data = Matrix.readTxt(new File ("src/test.txt"),20, 2 );
        Matrix x = data.getCol(0);
        Matrix y = data.getCol(1);
        //fitting model
        LinearRegressionModel l = new LinearRegressionModel(x, y);
        Metrics test = new MeanSquaredLoss(500, null, y );
        Matrix weights =  l.fit(5000,0.01 , test);
        //outputs
        double[][] testValues = {{7}};
        Matrix values = new Matrix(testValues);
        Matrix answers = l.predict(values);

        System.out.println("Equation: " + l.getEquation());

}
```

## Output: 
```

## What's to come: 
* Gradient Checking (in progress)
* Nueral Networks 
* More Metrics (cross entropy, etc.)
